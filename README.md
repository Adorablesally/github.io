# Project 1

**Title:** [Customer experience Insights For Airlines](https://github.com/Adorablesally/github.io/blob/main/Airline%20Review%20Project.xlsm)

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel (Pivot Table, Pivot chart, Conditional Formating, Slicers,Timelines)

**Project Description:**This project involved analysing customer reviews from various airlines to determine overall passenger experience. It is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of key performance metrics. This dashboard allows stakeholders to easily monitor and analyze the companyâ€™s performance across different routes, based on the type of Airline, flight class, type of travellers as well as the review date of the customers. The dashboard includes the following features:
Type of travellers on Monthly basis: This detailed comprehensively the type of travellers we have on monthly basis whether Solo travcellers, couples or those that travel for business purposes.
Airline ratings by staff services: This gives an insight into travellers rate the airline staffs based on their own customer service experience.
Monthly trend of overall ratings: This enables close monitoring of travellers ratings whether there is an increase or decrease compared to the previous months.
Ratings by Airlines: Highlights the Airline that has the best ratings than the other based on the overall ratings from their customers.
Ratings By type of Travellers: This visualises the type of traveller that gives the overall best ratings across all the rating metrics
Additionally, the dashboard includes interactive slicers and timeline for:
Month: Filter the data to view performance for a specific month or range of months.
Routes: Focus on Airline routes and the preferred airline routes by customers.


**Key findings:**
Ratings By value for money: Some customers rate the airline poorly because they believed that the service being rendered by the airline did not match the amount they paid.
Top rated Airline By travel or Class: Some Airlines performed better than the other  by travel class. For exacmple, some airlines had best ratings from first class travels and lower ratings from economy travellers, while some had best ratingss from business class travellers and poor ratings from first class travellersaccording to their experience.

# Project 2

**Title:**
employee data interrogation and manipulation

**SQL Code:**
[employee SQL code](https://github.com/Adorablesally/github.io/commit/4f8b6d02fc34e49018a5de5a8e912fd57ae41556)

**SQL Skills Used:**
Data Retrieval (SELECT): Queried and extracted specific information from the database.
Data Aggregation (SUM, COUNT): Calculated totals, such as sales and quantities, and counted records to analyze data trends.
Data Filtering (WHERE, BETWEEN, IN, AND): Applied filters to select relevant data, including filtering by ranges and lists.
Data Source Specification (FROM): Specified the tables used as data sources for retrieval
 

**Project Description:**
This project focuses on the analysis of a comprehensive dataset containing detailed information about approximately 11,000 football players. The primary objective is to utilize SQL for extracting meaningful insights regarding player demographics, performance metrics, and other relevant attributes.
Database Design and Implementation: Develop a relational database schema to effectively store and manage the football players' data, ensuring normalization and referential integrity.
Data Analysis Using SQL: Execute SQL queries to analyze various aspects of the dataset, including: Player demographics (e.g., age, nationality). Performance metrics (e.g., ratings, positions). Financial attributes (e.g., wages, market value).
Insight Extraction: Identify patterns and trends within the data, such as: Nationalities with the highest representation among players. Correlation between player attributes and performance metrics. Distribution of players across different clubs and leagues.
Reporting and Visualization: Present the findings through comprehensive reports and visualizations to facilitate better understanding and decision-making. By the end of this project, we aim to have a fully functional SQL database capable of providing in-depth analysis of football players' data, offering valuable insights for stakeholders such as team managers, scouts, and analysts
 
**Technology used:**
SQL server
